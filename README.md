# AI Jumbotron: Next-Gen Fan Experience 🏈

> Transforming stadium screens into interactive fan engagement platforms using real-time AI and crowd participation.

## 🌟 Project Story

At modern sports events, Jumbotrons are a one-way communication channel, showing replays and basic stats. We asked ourselves: "What if the Jumbotron could interact with fans in real-time?" This led to AI Jumbotron, a revolutionary platform that turns every fan's phone into a remote control for the stadium experience.

### The Inspiration

During a crucial Eagles game, we noticed how fans were split on a controversial call. Some cheered, others booed, but there was no way to quantify this collective reaction. This sparked our idea: what if we could capture these fan reactions in real-time and display them on the Jumbotron? What if we could turn passive spectators into active participants in the game-day experience?

### What We Learned

This project pushed us to explore:
- Real-time data synchronization across thousands of devices
- Scalable WebSocket architecture for instant updates
- React Native animations for fluid, engaging UIs
- AI-powered sentiment analysis for crowd reactions
- Stadium-scale deployment considerations

### How We Built It

1. **Initial Prototype**: Started with a basic React Native app for fan voting
2. **Backend Evolution**: Developed a robust WebSocket server for real-time updates
3. **AI Integration**: Added machine learning for crowd sentiment analysis
4. **UI Polish**: Created fluid animations and intuitive interfaces
5. **Testing**: Simulated large-scale user interactions

### Challenges We Faced

1. **Scale**: Handling thousands of simultaneous connections
2. **Latency**: Ensuring real-time updates across the stadium
3. **UI/UX**: Creating intuitive interfaces for quick fan interaction
4. **Integration**: Combining multiple data streams into cohesive displays

## 🚀 About the Project
