NFL Mock Server Example

This example demonstrates how to start the NFL Mock API server and make HTTP requests
to it. The server exposes all NFLMockClient functionality through REST endpoints.

IMPORTANT: The included VCR cassettes have comprehensive list data (all teams, players, games)
but detailed entity data is limited to specific items (e.g., only Philadelphia Eagles for
team details). See README "Data Availability & Limitations" section for full details.

Usage:
    # Run the server
    python example_nfl_server.py

    # Or run the server directly
    python -m pulse_mock.server --host localhost --port 1339 --debug

    # Then make HTTP requests (in another terminal/browser)
    curl http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues
    curl http://localhost:1339/v1/leagues/NFL/teams
    curl http://localhost:1339/health
